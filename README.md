# bevy
a repository to learn bevy, the rust based video game engine

## some things about this repo

I will be starting with "The Bevy Book" to learn Bevy. I first tried with a couple of youtube tutorials, but I realized really quickly that I didn't have enough base knowledge to troubleshoot some issues where my exact same code wasn't doing the same thing that was happening in the *opening* video for those tutorials.

Thus, "The Bevy Book" is going to be my guide to learning Bevy, until it either gets to complicated, or I  have enough knowledge to build what I want to build.

## some things about "why bevy"

In order to realize my goals with Flarnchain, I need to be able to build digital worlds. Bevy is a game engine, and thus one can build digital worlds with it. It also is written in Rust, which is the programming language used to build many blockchain applications. It also allows for deploying applications directly to the web via webassembly (wasm), which will be crucial for user experience, since I don't want people to have to download some sort of client to traverse the digital world that is the flarnchain blockchain.
